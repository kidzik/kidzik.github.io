abstract = "For MOOC learners, lecture video viewing  is  the  central learning  activity.  This  paper  reports  a  large-scale  analysis of in-video interactions. We categorize the video behaviors into patterns by employing a clustering methodology, based on the available types of interactions, namely, pausing, forward and backward seeking and speed changing. We focus on how learners view MOOC videos with these interaction patterns, especially  on  exploring  the  relationship  between  video  interaction  and perceived video difficulty, video revisiting behaviors and student performance. Our findings provide insights for improving the MOOC learning experiences"

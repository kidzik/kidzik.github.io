      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve build a musculoskeletal reinforcement learning environment for studying motor control using modern methods from computer science, neuroscience, biomechanics, etc.
I&amp;rsquo;ve set up a competition to build models of the brain in the crowdAI. Competition was accepted as one of the 5 official competitions at NIPS 2017 and one of 8 competitions at NIPS 2018, attracting over 500 teams from all over the world.
Here are some solutions from the first challenge</description>

      <description>Human movement results from the intricate coordination of muscles, tendons, joints, and other physiological elements. While children learn to walk, run, climb, and jump in their first years of life and most of us can navigate complex environments&amp;ndash;like a crowded street or moving subway&amp;ndash;without considerable active attention, developing controllers that can efficiently and robustly synthesize realistic human motions in a variety of environments remains a grand challenge for biomechanists, neuroscientists, and computer scientists.</description>
